<h2 id="why-not-just-use-store-x">Why not just use store X?</h2>

<p><span class="newthought">Durability should be simple and flexible.</span>  When I started to
design <a href="https://github.com/replikativ/replikativ">replikativ</a> I investigated
many different IO options, including many key-value or document stores like
CouchDB, Riak, MongoDB, IndexedDB etc. <!--more--> My trouble was that I wanted
to have cross-platform code also targeting ClojureScript while I didn’t need a
particular storage access pattern from the start. Also deciding for any
particular storage is in most cases premature as IO specific requirements change
in the lifecycle of an application. <label for="Four" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Four" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In my experience people
tend to use one or two storage solutions they know instead of using something
minimilastic and then plugging in a more elaborate storage solution when their
application needs it. This then complects what features are really required by
the application and what is used just because the storage solution prescribes
it. </span></p>

<p>With ClojureScript in particular a problem arises, as this is not a local
decision which can be factored away, but either you introduce callbacks
everywhere or you default
to <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a>, besides other more
exotic options. You then need to wrap all your code in go-routines for
ClojureScript and hence platform-neutral code becomes in the same way affected
as code is by IO in Haskell. Since I wanted to have a reasonable default, we
picked the back then new core.async and get a sane sequential programming model.
This put me out of luck, as all previous JVM libraries and approaches use
synchronous IO. I also wanted to start with the minimum necessary, which was the
semantics of a Clojure hash-map for me.</p>

<p>The situation has barely changed as truely platform neutral code for IO
operations like storage and network is not yet well established in the
Clojure(Script) community. <a href="https://github.com/replikativ/konserve">konserve</a>
(for storage IO) and <a href="https://github.com/replikativ/kabel">kabel</a> (for network
IO) are efforts to change that and significantly facilitate the development with
core.async.</p>

<h2 id="flexibility-by-simplicity">Flexibility by simplicity</h2>

<p><label for="Two" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="Two" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Simple and flexible way to store things reliably. Both the
material and the language can be switched to address different
tradeoffs:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Lachish_III_obv.JPG/595px-Lachish_III_obv.JPG" alt="Historic piece of stone with letters" /> </span></p>

<p>I designed and we use konserve in production as a simple interface to do common
tasks like <em>session storages</em> in backends, file storage for <em>caches of binary
data</em> in Clojure(Script) and in general any way to durably <em>store state</em> when
Datomic’s query capabilities are not necessary. Furthermore advanced storage
concepts should be facilitated by such a building block for persistent
datastructure concepts, e.g.
the <a href="https://github.com/datacrypt-project/hitchhiker-tree">hitchhiker-tree</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/replikativ/durable-persistence">durable-persistence</a> and
particulary for
the
<a href="https://github.com/replikativ/replikativ/tree/master/src/replikativ/crdt">CRDTs in replikativ</a>.
So what is desired?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>simple</em><label for="Three" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Three" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In Rich Hickey’s sense as logically simple. </span>
durable IO protocol as a building block</li>
  <li><em>composable</em> to more sophisticated semantics, e.g. append-log</li>
  <li><em>threadsafe</em> and safe to use without draining core.async’s threadpool with
synchronous IO</li>
  <li><em>ACID</em> properties on the key level, where consistency and durability depend on
the underlying store while atomicity and isolation are provided by konserve</li>
  <li>should be reasonable for <em>95% of usage</em>: both in <em>performance</em> and <em>function</em></li>
  <li><em>minimalism</em>: pluggable different backend stores fullfilling konserve semantics:
memory, filestore, IndexedDB, LevelDB, redis, riak, CouchDB</li>
  <li>natural Clojure interface with <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn">edn</a>
<em>associative key-value semantics</em></li>
  <li>first-class, <em>pluggable serialization</em> mechanism
(through <a href="https://github.com/replikativ/incognito">incognito</a>)</li>
  <li>allow <em>raw binary</em> IO if desired</li>
  <li><em>hosted</em> concept with transparent access to the underlying store</li>
  <li><em>minimal dependencies</em> by default</li>
</ul>

<p>By reducing the storage interface to a simple key-value store with a core.async
interface and edn serialization one gets a very good tradeoff to not having to
reason about the interface:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">&lt;!!</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">k/assoc-in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">store</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">:bar</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">&lt;!!</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">k/get-in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">store</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">:bar</span><span class="p">]))</span><span class="w"> </span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="opting-out">Opting out</h2>

<p>It is still possible to get gradually more <em>direct access</em> to the underlying
store possible, e.g. for performance or specific features like transactional
safety or batch processing, similar to the way Clojure exposes the underlying
JVM primitives and interfaces. Konserve furthermore reuses popular Clojure
libraries for backends where possible to not reinvent the wheel and allow
comfortable direct access. Konserve provides a reasonable default store without
dependencies or setup required for the JVM (filestore) and the Browser
(IndexedDB).</p>

<p>Performance is fairly good for small key-value pairs accessed in parallel, which
is exploited for instance in replikativ by using Merkle-Tree like structures. In
general you pay a neglegible cost for the konserve protocol and the usual cost
for edn serialization depending on the serializer. The implementation of more
advanced storage features on top is intended, for instance a fast append-log
with reduction is already implemented and used in replikativ. <label for="One" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="One" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A write-through caching scheme could also become attractive as well as a small
REST interface exposing konserve operations. </span></p>

<p>Dealing with errors in core.async <a href="https://whilo.github.io/articles/16/error-handling1">is not always easy</a>, so it can be helpful to
use <a href="https://github.com/replikativ/superv.async">superv.async</a> instead of plain
core.async. Errors happening are returned as wrapped exceptions and need to be
rethrown in case you expect this. I hope you find it a useful storage default
and report back in
the
<a href="https://gitter.im/replikativ/replikativ?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badge">gitter chat</a> or
on the Clojure mailing list. Happy storing! :)</p>
